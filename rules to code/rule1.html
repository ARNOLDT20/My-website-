  <p>Promise yourself just 20 minutes of coding. The hardest part is starting, and once you begin, your brain often chooses to continue. This trick beats procrastination!</p>
   <p> <center>Learning to code is a bit like 
going to the gym.</center></p>
<P> Even if you max out and spend a whole weekend at the 
gym, you will not see a visible difference in your body. The 
more regularly you learn to code, the more likely it is that 
you‚Äôll start seeing your ripped coding muscles. üí™ (The 
irony is not lost on me).</P>
<p> But the problem is where do you find the time? Between 
working your full-time job, spending time with your family 
and life admin, when are you supposed to sit down and 
practice this ‚Äúdaily coding‚Äù?</p>
<p>As humans, we have a lot of inertia. This can be bad for us - 
I‚Äôm looking at you, ‚Äú24‚Äù box set. However, we can also turn 
it to our advantage. I found that once I started coding and 
making things, I got so absorbed into the project that I no 
longer cared about TV, food or sleep. There were quite a 
few weekends when I coded until sunrise.</p>
<p> So how do we take advantage of this inertia? </p>
<p>First, you must understand that task-switching is very 
difficult. It requires a lot of motivation. If as soon as you 
get home, you slump on the sofa and switch on the TV, 
you‚Äôve already lost that evening. This is because the 
amount of motivation required to task-switch and do 
something not driven by evolution like eating or sleeping is 
a Herculean task. 
This is why the moment you enter the door and change to a 
new environment is the most crucial. If at this moment, 
you tell yourself that you are just going to do 20 minutes of 
coding practice, you will most likely succeed and use your 
inertia to end up learning for an hour or more. No brain 
will perceive a 20-minute task as a lot of effort and you end 
up tricking your brain to take advantage of your evening. </p>
<p>Learning to code is a bit like 
going to the gym.
 The next step is to develop a habit. Research suggests that 
to develop a new habit, you have to carry out the task daily 
for a month. I‚Äôve used this next trick for loads of different 
things, from exercising to coding, it invariably works like a 
charm. To preface this trick, I want you to imagine a wall 
with five paintings hanging on it, four of which are 
perfectly aligned, perfectly horizontal, but one is crooked</p>

<p> Now really imagine it, is there a part of you that wants to 
fix it?</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs imagine a monthly calendar with boxes 
representing individual days. If you nurture that new habit 
on a particular day, then you make a line through that day. 
If you continue your streak the next day then you extend 
that line and so forth. There is something about not 
breaking a continuous line that motivates most people to 
continue to develop a habit. As strange as it sounds, there 
are many times when I would have given up, but was 
compelled to continue because of a long, continuous line.</p>
