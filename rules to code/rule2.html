  <h1>When I first started learning 
how to code,</h1>

  <p>Apply what you learn by building something real. Projects give your learning direction and excitement.</p>
  <p> there were countless times when I picked it up then gave 
up, again and again. This is a common story amongst 
self-taught coders. Looking back, after teaching so many 
students, I finally realise what‚Äôs going on. A lot of 
beginners start learning to code by picking an arbitrary 
language and following along with a bunch of tutorials. 
Copying code, line by line, sometimes writing code to work 
out prime numbers, other times to find all the even 
numbers.</p>
<p>But you know what? I can find prime numbers a lot faster 
by Googling for it and picking out even numbers is not all 
that interesting.</p>
<p> Here‚Äôs the truth. If you are learning to code for the sake of 
learning to code, it‚Äôll be pretty difficult for you to get good 
at it. Skills that require a lot of time to hone, like 
programming, will eat into your pool of internal 
motivation. Something from within that makes you forget 
to eat and sleep. I can honestly say that coding on my own 
projects is one of the most enjoyable things I do.</p>
<p>It combines logical thinking with creativity, and at the end, 
you will have made something. In most cases, something 
that the world has never seen. Something that could make 
your life easier or more enjoyable. Something that could 
make loads of people's lives easier and more enjoyable. It‚Äôs 
like making a crazy-beautiful custom motorbike in your 
garage, without needing the garage or spending a cent on 
the components. </p>
<p>This is what motivates most people. The creating part. The 
making part. So I urge you to start learning to code by 
following a tutorial that makes something, anything.</p>
<p>Of course, it‚Äôs unlikely that at the beginning, you'll be able 
to code up Clash of Clans or League of Legends. But you‚Äôll 
be able to make something interesting. It could be a dice 
game or a flash-card app. But as long at the end of the 
tutorial, you‚Äôll have made something you can use and play 
with, then you‚Äôll be far more motivated to code to the end. 
During all our courses, we always tell our students to think 
up a simple app that they want to make. Something that 
uses the skills that they‚Äôve learned during the course but 
will also stretch them a little because they have to find out 
how to include some new functionality.</p>
<p>We had a student who went on to make an app that wakes 
Learning to code is a bit like 
going to the gym.
 them up a minute earlier every day to ease the transition to 
an earlier waking time. There‚Äôs a student who made a 
custom slideshow app as a mother‚Äôs day present. Someone 
else made an app that is a timer for making perfect steaks 
based on their weight and thickness. 
There are no limits on your imagination. It will be difficult 
when you start working on your own app because there are 
no step-by-step instructions, but it will also bring about the 
biggest improvement in your coding ability.
